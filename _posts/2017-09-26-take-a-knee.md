# Take a knee

Here we go again. "Those elitist liberal snowflakes disrespecting our troops by not standing for the National Anthem. How dare they! Don't they know that our troops are fighting for their freedom. They should be thanking them, not spitting on their sacrifice."

There is a disconnect happening here. Something is getting lost in translation. Colin Kaepernick and others have tried to make clear that their taking a knee or sitting during the National Anthem has nothing to do with our honored men and women in the military. What it is about is unarmed black bodies being killed by police officers.

I know why we do it. I understand it. Those that dislike the protest of the National Anthem are looking at the flag as a banner that our troops carry with them into battle, and a blanket draped over the coffins of those who gave their all for our freedom. The outrage would be understandable if we were talking about radical Christian groups who choose to protest at the funerals of fallen soldiers. Because that _**is**_ disrespecting our troops.

But what is happening at the beginning of our beloved football games has nothing to do with the troops except as American citizens who need to wake up and pay attention to the injustices back home.

The intention is not to disrespect men and women in uniform. If that was the reason I would be right there with you, outraged, at such disrespectfulness. But that is not the reason. That is not why these professional athletes are kneeling or sitting during the anthem. It is a tactic to make you and I pay attention. It is a strategy to stir the national consciousness in the hopes that discussions will be had, and blogs written and perspectives changed.

And that, I think, is why we don't like these protests. They make us think and reconsider our positions or they challenge our long held beliefs. But there is a hypocrisy that needs to be pointed out.

Those that are upset about the protesting of the National Anthem are the same people upset when racial tension boils over into riots. The same people will say of both types of protest that they wish they could find a different way to express themselves. Something that doesn't interfere with their lives.

And right there, that, the "interfering with our lives part" is exactly why they will keep taking a knee. That is exactly why mobs of people will block the highway and make you get stuck in traffic. You, we, all of us, need to be disrupted. We need to see these protests for what they are: an alarm clock for the national consciousness. A rabble roused with the soul intent of waking us from our slumber, from our complacency. It is supposed to upset you. It is supposed to make you think. And until enough people wake to make a change we will keep being inconvenienced and offended.

I think a better measure of patriotism and loyalty to our nation can be found in the pledge of allegiance. You remember it don't you? We all used to recite it in grade school. We would stand at our desks, face old glory, put our hands over our hearts and say:

_I pledge allegiance to the flag, of the United States of America. And to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God(?), indivisible, with liberty and justice for all._

(We're going to just stick a pin in the whole "having school children pledge allegiance when they have no idea what it really means" thing for another day.)

There are some _great_ words in there, _**GREAT**_ words. Allow me to paraphrase them: One people, that cannot be divided, possessing freedom and seeking justice for all.

Great words! Powerful words. Words that bear in their meaning the reason football players refuse to stand for the National Anthem. We may be one people but we divided on just about everything. And that freedom we hold so dear and shed blood to protect is not given out in equal measure to all people. And, to quote the great Martin Luther King Jr. "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

This protest is not a protest about flags and military personnel. If that's what you think it's about you are missing the point. And as long as you keep missing the point those who are already awake are going to keep trying to wake you up.

Something that is helpful to me when determining which side of an issue I should be on is to imagine on which side Jesus would be standing. And wherever I see Jesus standing, that is where I am going to stand as well. 100% of the time that is going to be with the lost, and the hurting, and the oppressed. And if that was the only question I asked about the issues it would still be enough to convince me of where I should stand.

Where are you standing? Where is Jesus standing? When you look around who else is standing with you? Start by answering those questions and the rest will come.
